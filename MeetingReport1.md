**Meeting Decisions:**

**1.Advantages of Waterfall:**The most important advantage of the waterfall model lies in the fact, that there is minimum planning overhead for the steps that are to follow, since the activities in each of the phase is carried out upfront, it is feasible that one does not have to plan for the entire phase. There is certain amount of discipline that is enforced as one has to only look into one phase of the process at any given point of time. In other models it is often difficult to nail the start and end of the said phase, which is not the case with the waterfall model. The most important of the advantage is that the project does not slip on its schedule. The number of resources working on the project does not keep on increasing with each passing day, as the planning for the same is done at the start of the phase itself.

We decided to choose Waterfall of software process models in meeting. The advatges are effective about the our decision. In additon, we decided to write the program in Java of Programming Language.
