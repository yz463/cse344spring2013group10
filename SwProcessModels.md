**The Waterfall Model**

• The waterfall model is the classic process
model – it is widely known, understood and used.
• In some respect, waterfall is the ”common
sense” approach.

**Advantages(Waterfall)**
1. Easy to understand and implement.
2. Widely used and known (in theory!)
3. Fits other engineering process models: civil, mech etc.
4. Reinforces good habits: define-before- design, designbefore-code
8. Identifies deliverables and milestones
9. Document driven: People leave, documents don’t
Published documentation standards: URD, SRD, … etc. ,
e.g. ESA PSS-05.
10. Works well on large/mature products and weak teams.

**Disadvantages(Waterfall)**
1. Doesn’t reflect iterative nature of exploratory
development.
2. Sometimes unrealistic to expect accurate requirements
early in a project
3. Software is delivered late, delays discovery of serious
errors.
4. No inherent risk management
5. Difficult and expensive to change decisions, ”swimming
upstream”.
6. Significant administrative overhead, costly for small
teams and projects.


**Evolutionary Development Types**

**Type 1: Exploratory Development:** Customer
assisted development that evolves a productfrom
ignorance to insight, starting from core, well
understood components (e.g. GUI?)

**Type 2: Throwaway Prototyping:** Customer
assisted development that evolves requirements
from ignorance to insight by means of
lightweight disposable prototypes.


**Spiral Model**

Extends waterfall model by adding iteration to explore
/manage risk
Project risk is a moving target. Natural to progress a project
cyclically in four step phases
1. Consider alternative scenarios, constraints
2. Identify and resolve risks
3. Execute the phase
4. Plan next phase: e.g. user req, software req, architecture
… then goto 1

**Key idea:** on each iteration identify and solve
the sub-problems with the highest risk.

**Advantages(Spiral)**
1. Realism: the model accurately reflects the
iterative nature of software development
on projects with unclear requirements
2. Flexible: incoporates the advantages of the
waterfall and evolutionary methods
3. Comprehensive model decreases risk
4. Good project visibility.

**Disadvantages(Spiral)**
1. Needs technical expertise in risk analysis
and risk management to work well.
2. Model is poorly understood by nontechnical management, hence not so
widely used
3. Complicated model, needs competent
professional management. High
administrative overhead.


**Component-based software engineering**

-Developing new software from pre-built components.
-Attempt to make an association between SE and other engineering disciplines.

**Advantages of CBSE**

-Management of Complexity
-Reduce Development Time
-Increased Productivity
-Improved Quality

**Disadvantages of CBSE**

-Development of Components
-Lack of Components
-Component Maintenance Costs
-Reliability and Sensitivity to changes
-Unsatisfied Requirements
-Trust

**Incremental delivery**

• Not a single delivery;
• Development and delivery in increments
• Each increment satisfies part of the required
functionality.
• User requirements are prioritised and the higher the
priority of a requirement the sooner it is delivered.
• Current increment’s requirements are frozen; but
requirements for later increments may evolve.

**Incremental development advantages**
• Delivery of increments provides earlier
availability of the system functionality.
• Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit
requirements for later increments.
• Lower risk of overall project failure.
• The highest priority system services tend to
receive the most testing.
